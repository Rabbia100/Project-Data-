Synthetic and Real-world datasets:
We have evaluated the performance and accuracy of our algorithm on synthetic (SYN*) MTS datasets and real-world MTS datasets (RWD*). 
We have used Dell Inc. 1.1.35, 11th Gen Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-11700 @ 2.50GHz, 2496 MHz, 8 Core(s) and 16 Logical Processors. All the algorithms are implemented in Python 3.10.4 and all the experiments are also performed on the same platform. 
Datasets Preparation for checking the accuracy and performance of the algorithm: https://github.com/Rabbia100/Project-Data-/blob/main/Synthetic%20and%20Real-world%20datasets%20.ipynb. We have created the SYN* and RWD* for the following two cases,
Case 1: Indirect association/relation of the data streams
Case 2: Direct association/relation of the data streams
All real-world data used is publicly available and can be found at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Parks-Recreation/Beach-Water-Quality-Automated-Sensors/qmqz-2xku/data
The sensor's location is also listed at, https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/g3ip-u8rb.
Synthetic datasets preparation for checking the efficiency of the algorithm:
To show the effectiveness of our algorithm we empirically evaluate our algorithm on four synthetic MTS datasets (E-SYN*). Each E-SYN* is composed of two data streams and that are time-synchronized and highly related. These synthetic datasets contain sinusoidal data of 100 Hz with a sampling frequency of 1 kHz and noise is added to every data point. The noise was generated by Gaussian distribution with zero mean and 0.1 standard deviation (0, 0.1). The data streams consist of the data ordered in time.
The code used to generate synthetic data is available at https://github.com/Rabbia100/Project-Data-/blob/main/E%20-%20Datasets%20-%20effectiveness%20of%20the%20algorithm%20DDMTS.ipynb.
